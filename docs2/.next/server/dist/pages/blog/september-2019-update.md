October 12, 2019.\n\nHere are the most significant improvements in September:\n\n- 💄 Add `startIcon` and `endIcon` props for the button. It makes it simpler to append an icon:\n\n  ![button icons](/static/blog/september-2019-update/button-icon.png)\n\n  ```jsx\n  import DeleteIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Delete';\n\n  <Button startIcon={<DeleteIcon />}>\n    Delete\n  </Button>\n  ```\n\n- 🔐 Add support for Chrome autofill. The `InputBase` component detects Chrome autofill events and updates the label position accordingly.\n\n  ![Autofill](/static/blog/september-2019-update/autofill.png)\n\n- 📊 Launch a [developer survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/5XHDL76) as a precursor to a major Date Picker enhancement effort. We plan a new investment batch of between 100 and 500 hours.\n\n- 📚 Change imports from `@material-ui/styles` to `@material-ui/core/styles`\n\n  The presence of two almost identical import paths has been a source of confusion: @material-ui/styles and @material-ui/core/styles.\n  Starting with v4.5.1, the documentation mentions @material-ui/core/styles as much as possible.\n\n  ```diff\n  -import { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/styles';\n  +import { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\n  ```\n\n  This change removes the need to install the `@material-ui/styles` package directly.\n  It prevents the duplication of `@material-ui/styles` in bundles and avoids confusion.\n  You can [learn more about the difference](https://material-ui.com/styles/basics/#material-ui-core-styles-vs-material-ui-styles) in the documentation.\n\nBut this summary is just scratching the surface. We have accepted 199 commits from 61 different contributors. We have changed 1,219 files with 18,223 additions and 11,957 deletions.\n\n## Our roadmap intent for October\n\n*(We'll do our best, no guarantee!)*\n\n- 🔍 We will provide a ready to use autocomplete, combo box, and multi-select components in the lab. You can already [preview it](https://deploy-preview-17037--material-ui.netlify.com/components/autocomplete/).\n\n  ![combobox](/static/blog/september-2019-update/combobox.png)\n  <p class=\"blog-description\">Combo box (limited options)</p>\n\n  ![multiselect](/static/blog/september-2019-update/multiselect.png)\n  <p class=\"blog-description\">Multi-select</p>\n\n  ![autocomplete](/static/blog/september-2019-update/autocomplete.png)\n  <p class=\"blog-description\">Autocomplete (free options)</p>\n\n- 📅 We will start to work on a [major upgrade](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui-pickers/issues/1293) of the date/time picker components.\n\n- 🧮 We will start to work on a Data Table component.\n⭐️ Notice that the advanced features of the data grid will be paid, behind an enterprise subscription. This is an effort part of [our roadmap](/discover-more/roadmap/) to answer enterprise needs.\n\n- ❓ Please upvote our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/issues) if you want something specific. The number of 👍 helps us to prioritize.\n"
