November 8, 2019.\n\nHere are the most significant improvements in October:\n\n- 🔍 We have introduced a new autocomplete / combo box / multi-select component [in the lab](/components/autocomplete/).\n\n  ![combobox](/static/blog/september-2019-update/combobox.png)\n\n  <p class=\"blog-description\">Combo box (limited options)</p>\n\n- 📚 We have changed the demos to automatically inline a small code preview when possible.\n\n  ![code preview](/static/blog/october-2019-update/preview.png)\n\n- ♿️ We have fixed 9 accessibility issues ([#18141](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/18141), [#18142](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/18142), [#17972](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/17972), [#18146](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/18146), [#17939](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/17939), [#17892](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/17892), [#17897](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/17897), [#17870](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/17870), [#18204](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/18204)).\n\n- 📦 We have introduced [codesandbox-ci](https://ci.codesandbox.io/status/Foso/material-ui/pr/18238). It can be useful when you want to live on the edge. For instance, you might want to rely on an unreleased commit that contains a bug fix.\n\nBut this summary is just scratching the surface. We have accepted 182 commits from 68 different contributors. We have changed 1,157 files with 31,312 additions and 9,771 deletions.\n\n## Our roadmap intent for November\n\n*(We'll do our best, no guarantee!)*\n\n- 💅 We will initiate an update of our styling solution.\nIt should cover styled-component [#6115](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/#6115), the system [#15561](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/issues/15561), dynamic props [#15573](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/issues/15573) and an unstyled version [#6218](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/6218).\n\n- 📅 We will start to work on a [major upgrade](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui-pickers/issues/1293) of the date/time picker components.\n\n- 🧮 We will start to work on a data table component. The core will be open-source. The advanced features of the data grid will be behind an enterprise subscription ⭐️.\nThis is an effort [of our roadmap](/discover-more/roadmap/) to better answer enterprise needs. To get a rough idea of what's coming, you can read: https://uxdesign.cc/design-better-data-tables-4ecc99d23356.\n\n- ❓ Please upvote our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/issues) if you want something specific. The number of 👍 helps us to prioritize.\n\nThese are three major efforts, we will likely need the whole quarter (Q4) to make significant progress. Stay tuned.\n"
