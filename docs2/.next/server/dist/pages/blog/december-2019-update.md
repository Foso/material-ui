January 7, 2020.\n\nHere are the most significant improvements in December:\n\n- 🚨 We have introduced a new [Alert](https://material-ui.com/components/alert/) component in the lab, thanks to **[@dimitropoulos](https://github.com/dimitropoulos)** ([#18702](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/18702)). The component also supports composition with a [Snackbar](/components/snackbars/#customized-snackbars).\n\n  ![Alert](/static/blog/december-2019-update/alert.png)\n\n  <p class=\"blog-description\">Standard variant</p>\n\n  ![Alert](/static/blog/december-2019-update/alert-filled.png)\n\n  <p class=\"blog-description\">Filled variant</p>\n\n- 👤 We have added [stacking](/components/avatars/#grouped) support to the avatar.\n\n  ![Stacking](/static/blog/december-2019-update/stacking.png)\n\n- ↕️ We have added [vertical](/components/buttons/#group-orientation) support to the button group.\n\n  ![Vertical button](/static/blog/december-2019-update/vertical-buttons.png)\n\n- 🌎 We have almost doubled the number of supported [locales](/guides/localization/#localization) from 13 to 22, thanks to our awesome contributors. [Help us](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/blob/master/packages/material-ui/src/locale/index.js) double this number next month 🚀!\n\nBut this summary is just scratching the surface. We have accepted 168 commits from 73 different contributors. We have changed 1,059 files with 13,468 additions and 8,584 deletions.\n\n## Our roadmap intent for January\n\n*(We'll do our best, no guarantee!)*\n\n- 💄 We will keep working on a new [pagination](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/19049) component.
