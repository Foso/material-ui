You can use it to see what changes are coming and provide better feedback to Material-UI contributors.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/versions/LatestVersions.js\", \"hideHeader\": true, \"bg\": \"inline\"}}\n\n## Versioning strategy\n\nStability ensures that reusable components and libraries, tutorials, tools, and learned practices don't become obsolete unexpectedly. Stability is essential for the ecosystem around Material-UI to thrive.\n\nThis document contains the practices that are followed to provide you with a leading-edge UI library, balanced with stability, ensuring that future changes are always introduced in a predictable way.\n\nMaterial-UI follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). Material-UI version numbers have three parts: `major.minor.patch`. The version number is incremented based on the level of change included in the release.\n\n- **Major releases** contain significant new features, some but minimal developer assistance is expected during the update. When updating to a new major release, you may need to run update scripts, refactor code, run additional tests, and learn new APIs.\n- **Minor releases** contain important new features. Minor releases are fully backward-compatible; no developer assistance is expected during update, but you can optionally modify your apps and libraries to begin using new APIs, features, and capabilities that were added in the release.\n- **Patch releases** are low risk, contain bug fixes and small new features. No developer assistance is expected during update.\n\n## Release frequency\n\nA regular schedule of releases helps you plan and coordinate your updates with the continuing evolution of Material-UI.\n\nIn general, you can expect the following release cycle:\n\n- A **major** release every 12 months.\n- 1-3 **minor** releases for each major release.\n- A **patch** release every week (anytime for urgent bugfix).\n\n## График выпуска\n\n| Date           | Version | Status   |\n|:-------------- |:------- |:-------- |\n| May 2018       | v1.0.0  | Released |\n| September 2018 | v3.0.0  | Released |\n| May 2019       | v4.0.0  | Released |\n| Q3 2020        | v5.0.0  | ⏳        |\n\n\nYou can follow the [milestones](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/milestones) for a more detailed overview.\n\n> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: We operate in a dynamic environment, and things are subject to change. The information provided is intended to outline the general framework direction. It's intended for informational purposes only. We may decide to add/remove new items at any time depending on our capability to deliver while meeting our quality standards. The development, releases and timing of any features or functionality of Material-UI remains at the sole discretion of Material-UI. The roadmap does not represent a commitment, obligation or promise to deliver at any time.\n\n## Политика поддержки\n\nFind details on the [supported versions](/getting-started/support/#supported-versions).\n\n## Deprecation practices\n\nSometimes **\"breaking changes\"**, such as the removal of support for select APIs and features, are necessary.\n\nTo make these transitions as easy as possible:\n\n- The number of breaking changes is minimized, and migration tools provided when possible.\n- The deprecation policy described below is followed, so that you have time to update your apps to the latest APIs and best practices.\n\n### Deprecation policy\n\n- Deprecated features are announced in the changelog, and when possible, with warnings at runtime.\n- When a deprecation is announced, recommended update path is provided.\n- Existing use of a stable API during the deprecation period is supported, so your code will keep working during that period.\n- Peer dependency updates (React) that require changes to your apps are only made in a major release.\n"
