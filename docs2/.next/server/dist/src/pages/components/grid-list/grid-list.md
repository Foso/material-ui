They help improve the visual comprehension of the content they hold.\n\n## Image-only Grid list\n\nA simple example of a scrollable image `GridList`.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/grid-list/ImageGridList.js\", \"hideEditButton\": true}}\n\n## Grid list with titlebars\n\nThis example demonstrates the use of the `GridListTileBar` to add an overlay to each `GridListTile`.\nThe overlay can accommodate a `title`, `subtitle` and secondary action - in this example an `IconButton`.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/grid-list/TitlebarGridList.js\", \"hideEditButton\": true}}\n\n## Single line Grid list\n\nThis example demonstrates a horizontal scrollable single-line grid list of images.\nHorizontally scrolling grid lists are discouraged because the scrolling interferes with typical reading patterns, affecting comprehension.\nOne notable exception is a horizontally-scrolling, single-line grid list of images, such as a gallery.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/grid-list/SingleLineGridList.js\", \"hideEditButton\": true}}\n\n## Advanced Grid list\n\nThis example demonstrates \"featured\" tiles, using the `rows` and `cols` props to adjust the size of the tile, and the `padding` prop to adjust the spacing.\nThe tiles have a customized titlebar, positioned at the top and with a custom gradient `titleBackground`.\nThe secondary action `IconButton` is positioned on the left.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/grid-list/AdvancedGridList.js\", \"hideEditButton\": true, \"defaultCodeOpen\": false}}\n"
