module.exports = "---\ntitle: Chip React component\ncomponents: Chip\n---\n\n# Chip\n\n<p class=\"description\">Chips are compact elements that represent an input, attribute, or action.</p>\n\n[Chips](https://material.io/design/components/chips.html) allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions.\n\nWhile included here as a standalone component, the most common use will\nbe in some form of input, so some of the behaviour demonstrated here is\nnot shown in context.\n\n## Chip\n\nExamples of Chips, using an image Avatar, SVG Icon Avatar, \"Letter\"\nand (string) Avatar.\n\n- Chips with the `onClick` property defined change appearance on focus,\n  hover, and click.\n- Chips with the `onDelete` property defined will display a delete\n  icon which changes appearance on hover.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/chips/Chips.js\"}}\n\n### Outlined Chips\n\nOutlined chips offer an alternative style.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/chips/OutlinedChips.js\"}}\n\n## Chip array\n\nAn example of rendering multiple Chips from an array of values.\nDeleting a chip removes it from the array. Note that since no\n`onClick` property is defined, the Chip can be focused, but does not\ngain depth while clicked or touched.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/chips/ChipsArray.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Small Chip\n\nYou can use the `size` prop to define a small Chip.\n\n### Default variant\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/chips/SmallChips.js\"}}\n\n### Outlined variant\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/chips/SmallOutlinedChips.js\"}}\n\n## Chip Playground\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/chips/ChipsPlayground.js\", \"hideHeader\": true}}\n\n## Accessibility\n\nIf the Chip is deletable or clickable then it is a button in tab order. When the Chip is focused (e.g. when tabbing) releasing (`keyup` event) `Backspace` or `Delete` will call the `onDelete` handler while releasing `Escape` will blur the Chip.\n"
