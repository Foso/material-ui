A fluid grid’s layout can use breakpoints to determine if the layout needs to change dramatically.\n\n### Basic grid\n\nThe column widths apply at all breakpoints (i.e. `xs` and up).\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/grid/CenteredGrid.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n### Grid with breakpoints\n\nSome columns have multiple widths defined, causing the layout to change at the defined breakpoint.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/grid/FullWidthGrid.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Interactive\n\nBelow is an interactive demo that lets you explore the visual results of the different settings:\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/grid/InteractiveGrid.js\", \"hideHeader\": true, \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Auto-layout\n\nThe Auto-layout makes the *items* equitably share the available space.\nThat also means you can set the width of one *item* and the others will automatically resize around it.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/grid/AutoGrid.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Complex Grid\n\nThe following demo doesn't follow the Material Design specification, but illustrates how the grid can be used to build complex layouts.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/grid/ComplexGrid.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Nested Grid\n\nThe `container` and `item` properties are two independent booleans. They can be combined.\n\n> A flex **container** is the box generated by an element with a computed display of `flex` or `inline-flex`. In-flow children of a flex container are called flex **items** and are laid out using the flex layout model.\n\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#box-model\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/grid/NestedGrid.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Negative margin\n\nThere is one limitation with the negative margin we use to implement the spacing between items.\nA horizontal scroll will appear if a negative margin goes beyond the `<body>`.\nThere are 3 available workarounds:\n1. Not using the spacing feature and implementing it in user space `spacing={0}` (default).\n2. Applying padding to the parent with at least half the spacing value applied to the child:\n```jsx\n  <body>\n    <div style={{ padding: 20 }}>\n      <Grid container spacing={5}>\n        //...\n      </Grid>\n    </div>\n  </body>\n```\n3. Adding `overflow-x: hidden;` to the parent.\n\n### white-space: nowrap;\n\nThe initial setting on flex items is `min-width: auto`.\nIt's causing a positioning conflict when the children is using `white-space: nowrap;`.\nYou can experience the issue with:\n```jsx\n<Grid item xs>\n  <Typography noWrap>\n```\n\nIn order for the item to stay within the container you need to set `min-width: 0`.\nIn practice, you can set the `zeroMinWidth` property:\n```jsx\n<Grid item xs zeroMinWidth>\n  <Typography noWrap>\n```\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/grid/AutoGridNoWrap.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n### direction: column | column-reverse\n\nThough the `Grid` component has a `direction` property that allows values of `row`, `row-reverse`, `column`, and `column-reverse`,\nthere are some features that are not supported within `column` and `column-reverse` containers.\nThe properties which define the number of grids the component will use for a given breakpoint\n(`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl`) are focused on controlling width\nand do **not** have similar effects on height within `column` and `column-reverse` containers.\nIf used within `column` or `column-reverse` containers, these properties may have undesirable effects on the width of the `Grid` elements.\n\n## CSS Grid Layout\n\nMaterial-UI doesn't provide any CSS Grid functionality itself, but as seen below you can easily use CSS Grid to layout your pages.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/grid/CSSGrid.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n"
