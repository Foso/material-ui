They can either be permanently on-screen or controlled by a navigation menu icon.\n\n[Side sheets](https://material.io/design/components/sheets-side.html) are supplementary surfaces primarily used on tablet and desktop.\n\n## Temporary drawer\n\nTemporary navigation drawers can toggle open or closed. Closed by default, the drawer opens temporarily above all other content until a section is selected.\n\nThe Drawer can be cancelled by clicking the overlay or pressing the Esc key.\nIt closes when an item is selected, handled by controlling the `open` prop.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/drawers/TemporaryDrawer.js\"}}\n\n## Swipeable Temporary drawer\n\nYou can make the drawer swipeable with the `SwipeableDrawer` component.\n\nThis component comes with a 2 kB gzipped payload overhead.\nSome low-end mobile devices won't be able to follow the fingers at 60 FPS.\nYou can use the `disableBackdropTransition` property to help.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/drawers/SwipeableTemporaryDrawer.js\"}}\n\nThe following properties are used in this documentation website for optimal usability of the component:\n- iOS is hosted on high-end devices.\nThe backdrop transition can be enabled without dropping frames.\nThe performance will be good enough.\n- iOS has a \"swipe to go back\" feature that interferes\nwith the discovery feature, so discovery has to be disabled.\n\n```jsx\nconst iOS = process.browser && /iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(navigator.userAgent);\n\n<SwipeableDrawer disableBackdropTransition={!iOS} disableDiscovery={iOS} />\n```\n\n## Responsive drawer\n\nThe `Hidden` responsive helper component allows showing different types of drawer depending on the screen width.\nA `temporary` drawer is shown for small screens while a `permanent` drawer is shown for wider screens.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/drawers/ResponsiveDrawer.js\", \"iframe\": true}}\n\n## Persistent drawer\n\nPersistent navigation drawers can toggle open or closed.\nThe drawer sits on the same surface elevation as the content.\nIt is closed by default and opens by selecting the menu icon, and stays open until closed by the user.\nThe state of the drawer is remembered from action to action and session to session.\n\nWhen the drawer is outside of the page grid and opens, the drawer forces other content to change size and adapt to the smaller viewport.\n\nPersistent navigation drawers are acceptable for all sizes larger than mobile.\nThey are not recommended for apps with multiple levels of hierarchy that require using an up arrow for navigation.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/drawers/PersistentDrawerLeft.js\", \"iframe\": true}}\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/drawers/PersistentDrawerRight.js\", \"iframe\": true}}\n\n## Mini variant drawer\n\nIn this variation, the persistent navigation drawer changes its width.\nIts resting state is as a mini-drawer at the same elevation as the content, clipped by the app bar.\nWhen expanded, it appears as the standard persistent navigation drawer.\n\nThe mini variant is recommended for apps sections that need quick selection access alongside content.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/drawers/MiniDrawer.js\", \"iframe\": true}}\n\n## Permanent drawer\n\nPermanent navigation drawers are always visible and pinned to the left edge, at the same elevation as the content or background. They cannot be closed.\n\nPermanent navigation drawers are the **recommended default for desktop**.\n\n### Full-height navigation\n\nApps focused on information consumption that use a left-to-right hierarchy.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/drawers/PermanentDrawerLeft.js\", \"iframe\": true}}\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/drawers/PermanentDrawerRight.js\", \"iframe\": true}}\n\n### Clipped under the app bar\n\nApps focused on productivity that require balance across the screen.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/drawers/ClippedDrawer.js\", \"iframe\": true}}\n"
