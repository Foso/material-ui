module.exports = "---\ncomponents: Typography\n---\n\n# Typography\n\n<p class=\"description\">Use typography to present your design and content as clearly and efficiently as possible.</p>\n\nToo many type sizes and styles at once can spoil any layout.\nA [typographic scale](https://material.io/design/typography/#type-scale) has a limited set of type sizes that work well together along with the layout grid.\n\n## General\n\nThe *Roboto* font will **not** be automatically loaded by Material-UI.\nThe developer is responsible for loading all fonts used in their application.\nRoboto Font has a few easy ways to get started. For more advanced configuration, check out\n[the theme customization section](/customization/typography/).\n\n## Roboto Font CDN\n\nShown below is a sample link markup used to load the Roboto font from a CDN:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap\" />\n```\n\n## Install with npm\n\nYou can [install it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typeface-roboto) by typing the below command in your terminal:\n\n`npm install typeface-roboto --save`\n\nThen, you can import it in your entry-point.\n\n```js\nimport 'typeface-roboto';\n```\n\nFor more info check out the [typeface](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces/tree/master/packages/roboto) project.\n\n⚠️ Be careful when using this approach.\nMake sure your bundler doesn't eager load all the font variations (100/300/400/500/700/900, italic/regular, SVG/woff).\nInlining all the font files can significantly increase the size of your bundle.\nMaterial-UI default typography configuration only relies on 300, 400, 500, and 700 font weights.\n\n## Component\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/typography/Types.js\"}}\n\n## Theme\n\nIn some situations you might not be able to use the `Typography` component.\nHopefully, you might be able to take advantage of the [`typography`](/customization/default-theme/?expand-path=$.typography) keys of the theme.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/typography/TypographyTheme.js\"}}\n\n## Changing the semantic element\n\nThe Typography component uses the `variantMapping` property to associate a UI variant with a semantic element.\nIt’s important to realize that the style of a typography is independent from the semantic underlying element.\n\n- You can change the underlying element for a one time occasion with the `component` property:\n\n```jsx\n{/* There is already an h1 in the page, let's not duplicate it. */}\n<Typography variant=\"h1\" component=\"h2\">\n  h1. Heading\n</Typography>\n```\n\n- You can change the mapping [globally using the theme](/customization/globals/#default-props):\n\n```js\nconst theme = createMuiTheme({\n  props: {\n    MuiTypography: {\n      variantMapping: {\n        h1: 'h2',\n        h2: 'h2',\n        h3: 'h2',\n        h4: 'h2',\n        h5: 'h2',\n        h6: 'h2',\n        subtitle1: 'h2',\n        subtitle2: 'h2',\n        body1: 'span',\n        body2: 'span',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Accessibility\n\nA few key factors to follow for an accessible typography:\n\n- **Color**. Provide enough contrast between text and its background, check out the minimum recommended [WCAG 2.0 color contrast ratio](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) (4.5:1).\n- **Font size**. Use [relative units (rem)](/customization/typography/#font-size) to accommodate the user's settings.\n- **Heading hierarchy**. [Don't skip](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/) heading levels. In order to solve this problem, you need to [separate the semantics from the style](#changing-the-semantic-element).\n"
