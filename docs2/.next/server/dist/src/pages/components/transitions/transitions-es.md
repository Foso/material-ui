The `style` property must be applied to the DOM for the animation to work as expected.\n\n```jsx\n// The `props` object contains a `style` property.\n// You need to provide it to the `div` element as shown here.\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\n  return (\n    <div {...props}>\n      Fade\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Main() {\n  return (\n    <Fade>\n      <MyComponent />\n    </Fade>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Collapse\n\nExpand vertically from the top of the child element. The `collapsedHeight` property can be used to set the minimum height when not expanded.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/transitions/SimpleCollapse.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Fade\n\nFade in from transparent to opaque.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/transitions/SimpleFade.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Grow\n\nExpand outwards from the center of the child element, while also fading in from transparent to opaque.\n\nThe second example demonstrates how to change the `transform-origin`, and conditionally applies the `timeout` property to change the entry speed.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/transitions/SimpleGrow.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Slide\n\nSlide in from the edge of the screen. The `direction` property controls which edge of the screen the transition starts from.\n\nThe Transition component's `mountOnEnter` property prevents the child component from being mounted until `in` is `true`. This prevents the relatively positioned component from scrolling into view from it's off-screen position. Similarly the `unmountOnExit` property removes the component from the DOM after it has been transition off screen.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/transitions/SimpleSlide.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Zoom\n\nExpand outwards from the center of the child element.\n\nThis example also demonstrates how to delay the enter transition.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/transitions/SimpleZoom.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## TransitionComponent prop\n\nThe components accept a `TransitionComponent` prop to customize the default transitions. You can use any of the above components or your own. It should respect the following conditions:\n\n- Accepts an `in` prop. This corresponds to the open/close state.\n- Call the `onEnter` callback prop when the enter transition starts.\n- Call the `onExited` callback prop when the exit transition is completed. These two callbacks allow to unmount the children when in a closed state and fully transitioned."
