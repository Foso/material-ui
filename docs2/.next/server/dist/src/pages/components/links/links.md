module.exports = "---\ncomponents: Link\n---\n\n# Links\n\n<p class=\"description\">The Link component allows you to easily customize anchor elements with your theme colors and typography styles.</p>\n\n## Simple links\n\nThe Link component is built on top of the [Typography](/api/typography/) component.\nYou can leverage its properties.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/links/Links.js\"}}\n\nHowever, the Link component has different default properties than the Typography component:\n\n- `color=\"primary\"` as the link needs to stand out.\n- `variant=\"inherit\"` as the link will, most of the time, be used as a child of a Typography component.\n\n## Security\n\nWhen you use `target=\"_blank\"` with Links, it is [recommended](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/noopener) to always set `rel=\"noopener\"` or `rel=\"noreferrer\"` when linking to third party content.\n\n- `rel=\"noopener\"` prevents the new page from being able to access the `window.opener` property and ensures it runs in a separate process.\n  Without this, the target page can potentially redirect your page to a malicious URL.\n- `rel=\"noreferrer\"` has the same effect, but also prevents the _Referer_ header from being sent to the new page.\n  ⚠️ Removing the referrer header will affect analytics.\n\n## Third-party routing library\n\nOne common use case is to perform navigation on the client only, without an HTTP round-trip to the server.\nThe `Link` component provides a property to handle this use case: `component`.\n\nHere is an [integration example with react-router](/guides/composition/#link).\n\n## Accessibility\n\n(WAI-ARIA: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#link)\n\n- When providing the content for the link, avoid generic descriptions like \"click here\" or \"go to\".\n  Instead, use [specific descriptions](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/descriptive-link-text).\n- For the best user experience, links should stand out from the text on the page.\n- If a link doesn't have a meaningful href, [it should be rendered using a `<button>` element](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/anchor-is-valid.md).\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/links/ButtonLink.js\"}}\n"
