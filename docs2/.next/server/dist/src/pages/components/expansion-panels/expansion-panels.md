You can learn more about this in the\n[overrides documentation page](/customization/components/).\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/expansion-panels/CustomizedExpansionPanels.js\"}}\n\n## Additional actions\n\nIn order to put an action such as a `Checkbox` or a button inside of the `ExpansionPanelSummary`, you need to stop the propagation of the focus and click events to prevent the panel from\nexpanding/collapsing when using the action.\nYou should also provide an `aria-label` for the action, otherwise the label of the nested action will be included in\nthe label of the parent button that controls the panel expansion.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/expansion-panels/ActionsInExpansionPanelSummary.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Performance\n\nThe content of ExpansionPanels is mounted by default even if the panel is not expanded.\nThis default behavior has server-side rendering and SEO in mind.\nIf you render expensive component trees inside your panels or simply render many\npanels it might be a good idea to change this default behavior by enabling the\n`unmountOnExit` in `TransitionProps`:\n\n```jsx\n<ExpansionPanel TransitionProps={{ unmountOnExit: true }} />\n```\n\nAs with any performance optimization this is not a silver bullet. Be sure to identify\nbottlenecks first and then try out these optimization strategies.\n\n## Secondary heading and Columns\n\nMultiple columns can be used to structure the content, and a helper text may be added to the panel to assist the user.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/expansion-panels/DetailedExpansionPanel.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Accessibility\n\n(WAI-ARIA: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#accordion)\n\nFor optimal accessibility we recommend setting `id` and `aria-controls` on the\n`ExpansionPanelSummary`. The `ExpansionPanel` will derive the necessary `aria-labelledby`\nand `id` for the content region of the panel.\n"
