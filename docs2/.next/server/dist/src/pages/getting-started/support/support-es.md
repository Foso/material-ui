module.exports = "# Support\n\n<p class=\"description\">From community help to premium critical business support, we‚Äôre here to help.</p>\n\n## Community help\n\nThe community is your first stop for questions and advice about the framework. Welcome to the community!\n\n### StackOverflow <img src=\"/static/images/logos/stackoverflow.svg\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\"StackOverflow logo\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\nFor crowdsourced technical questions from expert Material-UI devs in our community. Also frequented by the Material-UI core team.\n\n[Post a question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/material-ui)\n\n### GitHub <img src=\"/static/images/logos/github.svg\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\"GitHub logo\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\nWe use GitHub issues exclusively as a bugs and feature requests tracker. If you think you have found a bug, or have a new feature idea, please start by making sure it hasn't already been [reported or fixed](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed). You can search through existing issues and pull requests to see if someone has reported one similar to yours.\n\n[Open an issue](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/issues/new/choose)\n\n#### New issue guidelines\n\n- Please follow the issue template.\n- Please begin the title with '[ComponentName]' where appropriate, and use a succinct description that helps others find similar issues. \n  - \"doesn't work\" ‚ùå\n  - \"[Button] Add support for <some feature>\" ‚úÖ\n- Please don't group multiple topics in one issue ‚Äì each should have its own issue instead.\n- Please don't comment \"+1\" on an issue. It spams the maintainers and doesn't help move the issue forward. Use GitHub reactions instead (üëç).\n\n### Blog üìù\n\nStay up to date with the development of the library by following the blog.\n\n[Read the latest posts](https://medium.com/material-ui/)\n\n### Recursos üìñ\n\n¬øNuevo en Material-UI? ¬°Es f√°cil de aprender si sabes por d√≥nde empezar!\n\n[Aprende Material-UI](/getting-started/learn/)\n\n### Twitter <img src=\"/static/images/logos/twitter.svg\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\"Twitter logo\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\nReceive the latest news on Material-UI.\n\n[Follow us](https://twitter.com/MaterialUI)\n\n### Supported versions\n\nThe Material-UI CE (Community Edition) has been 100% open-source (MIT) since the very beginning, and always will be. Developers can ensure Material-UI is the right choice for their React applications through Material-UI‚Äôs community maintenance strategy. The Material-UI team regularly ships new releases, bug fixes, and is very welcoming to community pull requests.\n\nGiven the reality of time and resource constraints, as well as the desire to keep innovating, over time it becomes necessary to shift focus to newer versions of the framework ([our release schedule](https://material-ui.com/versions/#release-frequency)), while making the transition to newer versions as smooth as possible, including publishing migration guides such as [this one for v4](/guides/migration-v3/). The open-source community is always welcome to submit new features and bug fixes as well.\n\nThe current status of each Material-UI version is as follows:\n\n- Material-UI v4 (hooks): ‚úÖ In active development.\n- Material-UI v3 (change supported browsers): ‚ö†Ô∏è Only handle security fixes.\n- ~Material-UI v2 (never existed)~.\n- Material-UI v1 (rewrite): ‚ùå Inactive.\n- Material-UI v0.x: ‚ùå Inactive.\n\nFor teams and organizations that require additional support for older versions, Material-UI has [options available](#enterprise).\n\n## Professional support (Premium)\n\n### Enterprise Edition\n\nAccelerate your company‚Äôs application development with a secure, long-term solution that‚Äôs optimized for enterprise and backed by Material-UI experts.\n\n- **Long Term version support.** LTS provides developers and organizations with additional stability and reliability in the applications they‚Äôre developing, including guaranteed service level agreements (SLAs) and advisory services.

You expect these guarantees from proprietary software, and you can get them when using open-source as well.\n\nThe end result? All of the capabilities you expect from commercial-grade software, for the full breadth of open-source you use. That means less time grappling with esoteric open-source trivia, and more time building your own applications ‚Äì and your business.\n\n[Get more details](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/npm-material-ui?utm_source=material_ui&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise)\n\n[Request a demo](https://tidelift.com/subscription/request-a-demo?utm_source=material_ui&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise)\n\n### Custom work üõ†\n\nTweak Material-UI to meet specific requirements.
