Developers can ensure Material-UI is the right choice for their React applications through Material-UI’s community maintenance strategy. The Material-UI team regularly ships new releases, bug fixes, and is very welcoming to community pull requests.\n\nGiven the reality of time and resource constraints, as well as the desire to keep innovating, over time it becomes necessary to shift focus to newer versions of the framework ([our release schedule](https://material-ui.com/versions/#release-frequency)), while making the transition to newer versions as smooth as possible, including publishing migration guides such as [this one for v4](/guides/migration-v3/). The open-source community is always welcome to submit new features and bug fixes as well.\n\nThe current status of each Material-UI version is as follows:\n\n- Material-UI v4 (hooks): ✅ In active development.\n- Material-UI v3 (change supported browsers): ⚠️ Only handle security fixes.\n- ~Material-UI v2 (never existed)~.\n- Material-UI v1 (rewrite): ❌ Inactive.\n- Material-UI v0.x: ❌ Inactive.\n\nFor teams and organizations that require additional support for older versions, Material-UI has [options available](#enterprise).\n\n## 专业支持(高级)\n\n### 企业版本\n\nAccelerate your company’s application development with a secure, long-term solution that’s optimized for enterprise and backed by Material-UI experts.\n\n- **Long Term version support.** LTS provides developers and organizations with additional stability and reliability in the applications they’re developing, including guaranteed service level agreements (SLAs) and advisory services.
