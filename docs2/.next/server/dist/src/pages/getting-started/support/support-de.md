module.exports = "# Unterstützung\n\n<p class=\"description\">Von Community-Hilfe bis hin zu erstklassiger Unternehmensunterstützung sind wir hier um Ihnen zu helfen.</p>\n\n## Community-Hilfe\n\nDie Community ist Ihre erste Anlaufstelle für Fragen und Beratung zu dem Framework. Willkommen in der Community!\n\n### StackOverflow <img src=\"/static/images/logos/stackoverflow.svg\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\"StackOverflow logo\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\nFür crowdsourced-technische Fragen von professionellen Material-UI-Entwickler in unserer community. Auch häufig besucht vom Material-UI Kernteam.\n\n[Stellen Sie eine Frage](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/material-ui)\n\n### GitHub <img src=\"/static/images/logos/github.svg\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\"GitHub logo\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\nWir verwenden GitHub Issues ausschließlich als Bug und Feature Request-Tracker. Wenn Sie denken, Sie haben einen Bug gefunden, oder haben eine neue Feature-Idee, bitte stellen Sie zuerst sicher, dass diese nicht bereits [gemeldet oder behoben](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed) wurde. Sie können bestehende Probleme und Pull-Requests durchsuchen, um zu sehen, ob jemand etwas ähnliches gemeldet hat.\n\n[Ein Ticket öffnen](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/issues/new/choose)\n\n#### New issue guidelines\n\n- Please follow the issue template.\n- Please begin the title with '[ComponentName]' where appropriate, and use a succinct description that helps others find similar issues. \n  - \"doesn't work\" ❌\n  - \"[Button] Add support for <some feature>\" ✅\n- Please don't group multiple topics in one issue – each should have its own issue instead.\n- Please don't comment \"+1\" on an issue. It spams the maintainers and doesn't help move the issue forward. Use GitHub reactions instead (👍).\n\n### Blog 📝\n\nStay up to date with the development of the library by following the blog.\n\n[Read the latest posts](https://medium.com/material-ui/)\n\n### Ressourcen 📖\n\nNeu bei der Material-UI? Es ist leichter zu lernen, wenn Sie wissen, wo Sie anfangen sollen!\n\n[Lernen Sie die Material-UI kennen](/getting-started/learn/)\n\n### Twitter <img src=\"/static/images/logos/twitter.svg\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\"Twitter logo\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\nReceive the latest news on Material-UI.\n\n[Follow us](https://twitter.com/MaterialUI)\n\n### Supported versions\n\nThe Material-UI CE (Community Edition) has been 100% open-source (MIT) since the very beginning, and always will be. Developers can ensure Material-UI is the right choice for their React applications through Material-UI’s community maintenance strategy. The Material-UI team regularly ships new releases, bug fixes, and is very welcoming to community pull requests.\n\nGiven the reality of time and resource constraints, as well as the desire to keep innovating, over time it becomes necessary to shift focus to newer versions of the framework ([our release schedule](https://material-ui.com/versions/#release-frequency)), while making the transition to newer versions as smooth as possible, including publishing migration guides such as [this one for v4](/guides/migration-v3/). The open-source community is always welcome to submit new features and bug fixes as well.\n\nThe current status of each Material-UI version is as follows:\n\n- Material-UI v4 (hooks): ✅ In active development.\n- Material-UI v3 (change supported browsers): ⚠️ Only handle security fixes.\n- ~Material-UI v2 (never existed)~.\n- Material-UI v1 (rewrite): ❌ Inactive.\n- Material-UI v0.x: ❌ Inactive.\n\nFor teams and organizations that require additional support for older versions, Material-UI has [options available](#enterprise).\n\n## Professional support (Premium)\n\n### Enterprise Edition\n\nAccelerate your company’s application development with a secure, long-term solution that’s optimized for enterprise and backed by Material-UI experts.\n\n- **Long Term version support.** LTS provides developers and organizations with additional stability and reliability in the applications they’re developing, including guaranteed service level agreements (SLAs) and advisory services. Take the time you need before upgrading to the latest active version of Material-UI, or remain confident in your application’s long-term supportability by staying on whichever version you’re most comfortable with. LTS is available as a paid service, it extends to Material-UI v1 implementations and higher.\n- **Version migration assistance**.\n- **Priority fixes**.\n- **Priority support**. Timely support and troubleshooting when you need it most.

You expect these guarantees from proprietary software, and you can get them when using open-source as well.\n\nThe end result? All of the capabilities you expect from commercial-grade software, for the full breadth of open-source you use. That means less time grappling with esoteric open-source trivia, and more time building your own applications – and your business.\n\n[Get more details](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/npm-material-ui?utm_source=material_ui&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise)\n\n[Request a demo](https://tidelift.com/subscription/request-a-demo?utm_source=material_ui&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise)\n\n### Custom work 🛠\n\nTweak Material-UI to meet specific requirements.
