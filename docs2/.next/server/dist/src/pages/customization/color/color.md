module.exports = "# Color\n\n<p class=\"description\">Convey meaning through color. Out of the box you get access to all colors in the Material Design spec.</p>\n\nThe Material Design [color system](https://material.io/design/color/) can be used to create a color theme that reflects your brand or style.\n\n## Color system\n\n### Important Terms\n\n#### \"Palette\"\n\nA palette is a collection of colors, i.e. hues and their shades. Material-UI provides all colors from the Material Design guidelines.\n[This color palette](#color-palette) has been designed with colors that work harmoniously with each other.\n\n#### \"Hue\" & \"Shade\"\n\nA single color within the palette is made up of a hue such as \"red\", and shade, such as \"500\".\n\"red 50\" is the lightest shade of red (*pink!*), while \"red 900\" is the darkest.\nIn addition, most hues come with \"accent\" shades, prefixed with an `A`.\n\n### Examples\n\nThe Material Design color palette comprises primary and accent colors that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colors.\nTheyâ€™ve been designed to work harmoniously with each other.\n\nFor instance, you can refer to complementary primary and accent colors (for example 'red 500' & 'purple A200'), like so:\n\n```js\nimport purple from '@material-ui/core/colors/purple';\nimport red from '@material-ui/core/colors/red';\n\nconst primary = red[500]; // #F44336\nconst accent = purple['A200']; // #E040FB\nconst accent = purple.A200; // #E040FB (alternative method)\n```\n\n### Color palette\n\nGiven a *HUE* (red, pink, etc.) and a *SHADE* (500, 600, etc.) you can import the color like this:\n\n```jsx\nimport HUE from '@material-ui/core/colors/HUE';\n\nconst color = HUE[SHADE];\n```\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/customization/color/Color.js\", \"hideHeader\": true, \"bg\": \"inline\"}}\n\n## Color tool\n\nTo test a [material.io/design/color](https://material.io/design/color/) color scheme with the Material-UI\ndocumentation, simply select colors using the palette and sliders below.\nAlternatively, you can enter hex values in the Primary and Secondary text fields.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/customization/color/ColorTool.js\", \"hideHeader\": true, \"bg\": true}}\n\nThe output shown in the color sample can be pasted directly into a [`createMuiTheme()`](/customization/theming/#createmuitheme-options-theme) function (to be used with [`ThemeProvider`](/customization/theming/#theme-provider)):\n\n```jsx\nimport { createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\nimport purple from '@material-ui/core/colors/purple';\n\nconst theme = createMuiTheme({\n  palette: {\n    primary: purple,\n    secondary: {\n      main: '#f44336',\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nOnly the `main` shades need be provided (unless you wish to further customize `light`, `dark` or `contrastText`), as the other colors will be calculated by `createMuiTheme()`, as described in the [Theme customization](/customization/palette/) section.\n\nIf you are using the default primary and / or secondary shades then by providing the color object, `createMuiTheme()` will use the appropriate shades from the material color for main, light and dark.\n\n### Official color tool\n\nThe Material Design team has also built an awesome palette configuration tool: [material.io/tools/color](https://material.io/tools/color/).\nThis can help you create a color palette for your UI, as well as measure the accessibility level of any color combination.\n\n<a href=\"https://material.io/tools/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0&primary.color=3F51B5&secondary.color=F44336\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">\n  <img src=\"/static/images/color/colorTool.png\" alt=\"Official color tool\" style=\"width: 574px\" />\n</a>\n\nThe output can be fed into `createMuiTheme()` function:\n\n```jsx\nimport { createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\n\nconst theme = createMuiTheme({\n  palette: {\n    primary: {\n      light: '#757ce8',\n      main: '#3f50b5',\n      dark: '#002884',\n      contrastText: '#fff',\n    },\n    secondary: {\n      light: '#ff7961',\n      main: '#f44336',\n      dark: '#ba000d',\n      contrastText: '#000',\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Tools by the community\n\n- [create-mui-theme](https://react-theming.github.io/create-mui-theme/): Is an online tool for creating Material-UI themes via Material Design Color Tool.\n- [material-ui-theme-editor](https://in-your-saas.github.io/material-ui-theme-editor/): A tool to generate themes for your Material-UI applications by just selecting the colors and having a live preview.\n- [Material palette generator](https://material.io/inline-tools/color/): The Material palette generator can be used to generate a palette for any color you input.\n"
