December 12, 2019.\n\nHere are the most significant improvements in November:\n\n- 🔍 We have polished the newly introduced Autocomplete component (October).\nWe have handled more than [100 related issues](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22lab%3A+Autocomplete%22+) in a single month.\n\n- 👤 We have improved the Avatar's loading experience ([#1871](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/18711)).\n\n  ![Loading avatar before](/static/blog/november-2019-update/loading-avatar-before.gif)\n\n  <p class=\"blog-description\">Before</p>\n\n  ![Loading avatar after](/static/blog/november-2019-update/loading-avatar-after.gif)\n\n  <p class=\"blog-description\">After</p>\n\n- 🌎 We have introduced [localization](/guides/localization/) support.\nThe framework supports [13 locales](/guides/localization/#supported-locales), and growing. We would love to see your translation contribution ✨.\n\n- 👨‍🎤 We have added [Framer X](https://packages.framer.com/package/material-ui/material-ui) support ([#17797](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/17797)) (and now looking into Sketch, Figma and Adobe XD).\n\n  <a href=\"https://packages.framer.com/package/material-ui/material-ui\"><img src=\"/static/blog/november-2019-update/framer.jpg\" alt=\"Framer X\" width=\"300\" /></a>\n\n- ⚛️ We have completed the migration of the demos to TypeScript. A big thanks to all the contributors that participated in [this effort](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/issues/14897). Around 10% of the audience on the documentation uses this version of the demos and growing.\n\n  ![TypeScript demo](/static/blog/november-2019-update/typescript-demos.png)\n\n- 🏷 We have added arrow and [hysteresis](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/18458) support to the Tooltip.\n\n  ![Tooltip arrow](/static/blog/november-2019-update/arrow.png)\n\nBut this summary is just scratching the surface. We have accepted 200 commits from 73 different contributors. We have changed 1,142 files with 27,923 additions and 13,852 deletions.\n\n## Our roadmap intent for December\n\n*(We'll do our best, no guarantee!)*\n\nWe have three major efforts undergoing, we will likely need a couple of months to make significant progress. Stay tuned.\n\n- 📅 We continue to work on a [major upgrade](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui-pickers/issues/1293) of the date/time picker components.\n\n- 🧮 We continue to work on a data grid component.\nThis is an effort [of our roadmap](/discover-more/roadmap/) to better answer enterprise needs.\nThe most advanced features will use a non-MIT license.\nTo get a rough idea of what's coming, you can read [this blog post](https://uxdesign.cc/design-better-data-tables-4ecc99d23356).\n\n- 💅 We might initiate an update of our styling solution.\nWe want to cover styled-component [#6115](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/#6115), the system [#15561](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/issues/15561), dynamic props [#15573](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/issues/15573) and an unstyled version [#6218](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/pull/6218).\n\n❓ Please upvote our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/issues) if you want something specific.
