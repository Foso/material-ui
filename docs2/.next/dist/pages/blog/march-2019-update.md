April 5, 2019.\n\nHere are the most significant improvements in March:\n\n- We have removed the old styles modules üíÖ.\nBe aware [of the difference](/customization/default-theme/#material-ui-core-styles-vs-material-ui-styles) between `@material-ui/core/styles` and `@material-ui/styles`.\n- The community has helped us to add many TypeScript demo variants. In order to minimize the overhead of handling two variants per demo (JavaScript & TypeScript), the JavaScript variant is generated from the TypeScript variant. If you are using TypeScript, you can ignore the `.propTypes =` assignations.\n- We have migrated a few demos from the `withStyles()` API to the `makeStyles()` API.\nIf you are wondering which you should use, we would encourage the use of `makeStyles()` where possible. `withStyles()` is interesting for overriding component styles or for handling legacy class logics.\n- We have made the [Box API](/system/basics/) stable ü•≥.\n  ```diff\n  -import { unstable_Box as Box } from '@material-ui/core/Box';\n  +import Box from '@material-ui/core/Box';\n  ```\n- We have committed to [a new Roadmap](/discover-more/roadmap/) (prioritized) for the next 6 months.\n- We have migrated 50% of the codebase from the Classes API to the Hooks API. Once we are done with this task we can remove the internal usage of higher-order components.\n- We have introduced [a simplified server-side rendering API](/styles/advanced/#server-side-rendering), inspired by styled-components.\n\n## Our roadmap intent for April\n\n*(We'll do our best, no guarantee!)*\n\n- We are almost done with [the v4.0.0-alpha breaking changes](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/issues/13663). You can already find [the upgrade path](/guides/migration-v3/) from v3 to v4 in the documentation. Next, we will release the first beta version (no more breaking changes).\nThe results of the Material-UI developer survey suggested that there are too many breaking changes.\nDon't worry, it's almost over! We will focus on providing more components once we have released v4 stable.\n- We will continue, and hopefully complete, the tasks we undertook:\n  - TypeScript demo variants.\n  - Migration from Classes to Hooks, removal of unnecessary internal components.\n  - Removal of `findDOMNode()`, support of `StrictMode`, forward of references.\n- ‚ùì Please upvote our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/issues) if you want something specific. The number of üëç helps us to prioritize.\n"
