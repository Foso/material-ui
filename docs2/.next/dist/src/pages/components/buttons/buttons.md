module.exports = "---\ntitle: Button React component\ncomponents: Button, IconButton, ButtonBase\n---\n\n# Button\n\n<p class=\"description\">Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.</p>\n\n[Buttons](https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html) communicate actions that users can take. They are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like:\n\n- Dialogs\n- Modal windows\n- Forms\n- Cards\n- Toolbars\n\n## Contained Buttons\n\n[Contained buttons](https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html#contained-button)\nare high-emphasis, distinguished by their use of elevation and fill.\nThey contain actions that are primary to your app.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/buttons/ContainedButtons.js\"}}\n\nYou can remove the elevation with the `disableElevation` prop.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/buttons/DisableElevation.js\"}}\n\n## Text Buttons\n\n[Text buttons](https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html#text-button)\nare typically used for less-pronounced actions, including those located:\n\n- In dialogs\n- In cards\n\nIn cards, text buttons help maintain an emphasis on card content.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/buttons/TextButtons.js\"}}\n\n## Outlined Buttons\n\n[Outlined buttons](https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html#outlined-button)\nare medium-emphasis buttons. They contain actions that are important,\nbut arenâ€™t the primary action in an app.\n\nOutlined buttons are also a lower emphasis alternative to contained buttons,\nor a higher emphasis alternative to text buttons.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/buttons/OutlinedButtons.js\"}}\n\n## Upload button\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/buttons/UploadButtons.js\"}}\n\n## Sizes\n\nFancy larger or smaller buttons? Use the `size` property.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/buttons/ButtonSizes.js\"}}\n\n## Buttons with icons and label\n\nSometimes you might want to have icons for certain button to enhance the UX of the application as we recognize logos more easily than plain text. For example, if you have a delete button you can label it with a dustbin icon.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/buttons/IconLabelButtons.js\"}}\n\n## Icon Buttons\n\nIcon buttons are commonly found in app bars and toolbars.\n\nIcons are also appropriate for toggle buttons that allow a single choice to be selected or\ndeselected, such as adding or removing a star to an item.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/buttons/IconButtons.js\"}}\n\n## Customized buttons\n\nHere are some examples of customizing the component. You can learn more about this in the\n[overrides documentation page](/customization/components/).\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/buttons/CustomizedButtons.js\", \"defaultCodeOpen\": false}}\n\nðŸ‘‘ If you are looking for inspiration, you can check [MUI Treasury's customization examples](https://mui-treasury.com/components/button).\n\n## Complex Buttons\n\nThe Text Buttons, Contained Buttons, Floating Action Buttons and Icon Buttons are built on top of the same component: the `ButtonBase`.\nYou can take advantage of this lower level component to build custom interactions.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/buttons/ButtonBase.js\"}}\n\n## Third-party routing library\n\nOne common use case is to use the button to trigger navigation to a new page.\nThe `ButtonBase` component provides a property to handle this use case: `component`.\nHowever for certain focus polyfills `ButtonBase` requires the DOM node of the provided\ncomponent. This is achieved by attaching a ref to the component and expecting that the\ncomponent forwards this ref to the underlying DOM node.\nGiven that many of the interactive components rely on `ButtonBase`, you should be\nable to take advantage of it everywhere.\n\nHere is an [integration example with react-router](/guides/composition/#button).\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Cursor not-allowed\n\nThe ButtonBase component sets `pointer-events: none;` on disabled buttons, which prevents the appearance of a disabled cursor.\n\nIf you wish to use `not-allowed`, you have two options:\n\n1. **CSS only**. You can remove the pointer events style on the disabled state of the `<button>` element:\n\n  ```css\n  .MuiButtonBase-root:disabled {\n    cursor: not-allowed;\n    pointer-events: auto;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  However:\n\n  - You should add `pointer-events: none;` back when you need to display [tooltips on disabled elements](/components/tooltips/#disabled-elements)\n  - The cursor won't change if you render something other than a button element, for instance, a link `<a>` element.\n\n2. **DOM change**. You can wrap the button:\n\n  ```jsx\n  <span style={{ cursor: 'not-allowed' }}>\n    <Button component={Link} disabled>\n      disabled\n    </Button>\n  </span>\n  ```\n\n  This has the advantage of supporting any element, for instance, a link `<a>` element.\n"
