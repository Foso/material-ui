This prevents the relatively positioned component from scrolling into view\nfrom it's off-screen position. Similarly the `unmountOnExit` property removes the component\nfrom the DOM after it has been transition off screen.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/transitions/SimpleSlide.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Zoom\n\nExpand outwards from the center of the child element.\n\nThis example also demonstrates how to delay the enter transition.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/transitions/SimpleZoom.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## TransitionComponent prop\n\nThe components accept a `TransitionComponent` prop to customize the default transitions.\nYou can use any of the above components or your own.\nIt should respect the following conditions:\n\n- Accepts an `in` prop. This corresponds to the open/close state.\n- Call the `onEnter` callback prop when the enter transition starts.\n- Call the `onExited` callback prop when the exit transition is completed.\nThese two callbacks allow to unmount the children when in a closed state and fully transitioned.\n"
