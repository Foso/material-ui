module.exports = "---\ntitle: Modal React component\ncomponents: Modal\n---\n\n# Modal\n\n<p class=\"description\">The modal component provides a solid foundation for creating dialogs, popovers, lightboxes, or whatever else.</p>\n\nThe component renders its `children` node in front of a backdrop component.\nThe `Modal` offers important features:\n\n- 💄 Manages modal stacking when one-at-a-time just isn't enough.\n- 🔐 Creates a backdrop, for disabling interaction below the modal.\n- 🔐 It disables scrolling of the page content while open.\n- ♿️ It properly manages focus; moving to the modal content,\n  and keeping it there until the modal is closed.\n- ♿️ Adds the appropriate ARIA roles automatically.\n- 📦 [5 kB gzipped](/size-snapshot).\n\n> **Terminology note**. The term \"modal\" is sometimes used to mean \"dialog\", but this is a misnomer.\nA modal window describes parts of a UI.\nAn element is considered modal if [it blocks interaction with the rest of the application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window).\n\nIf you are creating a modal dialog, you probably want to use the [Dialog](/components/dialogs/) component rather than directly using Modal.\nModal is a lower-level construct that is leveraged by the following components:\n\n- [Dialog](/components/dialogs/)\n- [Drawer](/components/drawers/)\n- [Menu](/components/menus/)\n- [Popover](/components/popover/)\n\n## Simple modal\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/modal/SimpleModal.js\"}}\n\nNotice that you can disable the outline (often blue or gold) with the `outline: 0` CSS property.\n\n## Transitions\n\nThe open/close state of the modal can be animated with a transition component.\nThis component should respect the following conditions:\n\n- Be a direct child descendent of the modal.\n- Have an `in` prop. This corresponds to the open / close state.\n- Call the `onEnter` callback prop when the enter transition starts.\n- Call the `onExited` callback prop when the exit transition is completed.\nThese two callbacks allow the modal to unmount the child content when closed and fully transitioned.\n\nModal has built-in support for [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group).\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/modal/TransitionsModal.js\"}}\n\nAlternatively, you can use [react-spring](https://github.com/react-spring/react-spring).\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/modal/SpringModal.js\"}}\n\n## Server-side modal\n\nReact [doesn't support](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13097) the [`createPortal()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) API on the server.\nIn order to display the modal, you need to disable the portal feature with the `disablePortal` prop:\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/modal/ServerModal.js\"}}\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Focus trap\n\nThe modal moves the focus back to the body of the component if the focus tries to escape it.\n\nThis is done for accessibility purposes, however, it might create issues.\nIn the event the users need to interact with another part of the page, e.g. with a chatbot window, you can disable the behavior:\n\n```jsx\n<Modal disableEnforceFocus />\n```\n\n## Accessibility\n\n(WAI-ARIA: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#dialog_modal)\n\n- Be sure to add `aria-labelledby=\"id...\"`, referencing the modal title, to the `Modal`.\nAdditionally, you may give a description of your modal with the `aria-describedby=\"id...\"` prop on the `Modal`.\n\n  ```jsx\n  <Modal\n    aria-labelledby=\"modal-title\"\n    aria-describedby=\"modal-description\"\n  >\n    <h2 id=\"modal-title\">\n      My Title\n    </h2>\n    <p id=\"modal-description\">\n      My Description\n    </p>\n  </Modal>\n  ```\n- The [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/dialog-modal/dialog.html) can help you set the initial focus on the most relevant element, based on your modal content.\n- A modal window overlys on either the primary window or another modal window. Windows under a modal are **inert**. That is, users cannot interact with content outside an active modal window.\n"
