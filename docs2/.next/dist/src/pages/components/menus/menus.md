It appears when the user interacts with a button, or other control.\n\n## Simple Menu\n\nSimple menus open over the anchor element by default (this option can be changed via props). When close to a screen edge, simple menus vertically realign to make sure that all menu items are completely visible.\n\nChoosing an option should immediately ideally commit the option and close the menu.\n\n**Disambiguation**: In contrast to simple menus, simple dialogs can present additional detail related to the options available for a list item or provide navigational or orthogonal actions related to the primary task. Although they can display the same content, simple menus are preferred over simple dialogs because simple menus are less disruptive to the userâ€™s current context.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/menus/SimpleMenu.js\"}}\n\n## Selected menus\n\nIf used for item selection, when opened, simple menus attempt to vertically align the currently selected menu item with the anchor element,\nand the initial focus will be placed on the selected menu item.\nThe currently selected menu item is set using the `selected` property (from [ListItem](/api/list-item/)).\nTo use a selected menu item without impacting the initial focus or the vertical positioning of the menu, set the `variant` property to `menu`.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/menus/SimpleListMenu.js\"}}\n\n## MenuList composition\n\nThe `Menu` component uses the `Popover` component internally.\nHowever, you might want to use a different positioning strategy, or not blocking the scroll.\nFor answering those needs, we expose a `MenuList` component that you can compose, with `Popper` in this example.\n\nThe primary responsibility of the `MenuList` component is to handle the focus.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/menus/MenuListComposition.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Customized menus\n\nHere is an example of customizing the component. You can learn more about this in the\n[overrides documentation page](/customization/components/).\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/menus/CustomizedMenus.js\"}}\n\nThe `MenuItem` is a wrapper around `ListItem` with some additional styles.\nYou can use the same list composition features with the `MenuItem` component:\n\n## Max height menus\n\nIf the height of a menu prevents all menu items from being displayed, the menu can scroll internally.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/menus/LongMenu.js\"}}\n\n## Limitations\n\nThere is [a flexbox bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=327437) that prevents `text-overflow: ellipsis` from working in a flexbox layout.\nYou can use the `Typography` component with `noWrap` to workaround this issue:\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/menus/TypographyMenu.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Change transition\n\nUse a different transition.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/menus/FadeMenu.js\"}}\n\n## Context menu\n\nHere is an example of a context menu. (Right click to open.)\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/menus/ContextMenu.js\"}}\n\n## Complementary projects\n\nFor more advanced use cases you might be able to take advantage of:\n\n### PopupState helper\n\nThere is a 3rd party package [`material-ui-popup-state`](https://github.com/jcoreio/material-ui-popup-state) that takes care of menu state for you in most cases.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/menus/MenuPopupState.js\"}}\n"
