Note that since both the exiting and entering\nanimations are triggered at the same time, we use `enterDelay` to allow the outgoing Floating Action Button's\nanimation to finish before the new one enters.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/floating-action-button/FloatingActionButtonZoom.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n"
