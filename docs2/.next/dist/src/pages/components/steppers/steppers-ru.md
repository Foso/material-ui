It provides a wizard-like workflow.</p>\n\n[Steppers](https://material.io/archive/guidelines/components/steppers.html) display progress through a sequence of logical and numbered steps. They may also be used for navigation. Steppers may display a transient feedback message after a step is saved.\n\n- **Types of Steps**: Editable, Non-editable, Mobile, Optional\n- **Types of Steppers**: Horizontal, Vertical, Linear, Non-linear\n\n> **Note:** Steppers are no longer documented in the [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/), but Material-UI will continue to support them.\n\n## Horizontal Stepper\n\n### Linear\n\nThe `Stepper` can be controlled by passing the current step index (zero-based) as the `activeStep` property. `Stepper` orientation is set using the `orientation` property.\n\nThis example also shows the use of an optional step by placing the `optional` property on the second `Step` component. Note that it's up to you to manage when an optional step is skipped. Once you've determined this for a particular step you must set `completed={false}` to signify that even though the active step index has gone beyond the optional step, it's not actually complete.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/steppers/HorizontalLinearStepper.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n### Linear - Alternative Label\n\nLabels can be placed below the step icon by setting the `alternativeLabel` prop on the `Stepper` component.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/steppers/HorizontalLinearAlternativeLabelStepper.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n### Customized Stepper\n\nНиже находится пример кастомизации компонента. You can learn more about this in the [overrides documentation page](/customization/components/).\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/steppers/CustomizedSteppers.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n### Non-linear\n\nNon-linear steppers allow users to enter a multi-step flow at any point.\n\nThis example is similar to the regular horizontal stepper, except steps are no longer automatically set to `disabled={true}` based on the `activeStep` property.\n\nThe use of the `StepButton` here demonstrates clickable step labels, as well as setting the `completed` flag. However because steps can be accessed in a non-linear fashion, it's up to your own implementation to determine when all steps are completed (or even if they need to be completed).\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/steppers/HorizontalNonLinearStepper.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n### Non-linear - Alternative Label\n\nLabels can be placed below the step icon by setting the `alternativeLabel` prop on the `Stepper` component.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/steppers/HorizontalNonLinearAlternativeLabelStepper.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n### Non-linear - Error Step\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/steppers/HorizontalNonLinearStepperWithError.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Vertical Stepper\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/steppers/VerticalLinearStepper.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Mobile Stepper\n\nThis component implements a compact stepper suitable for a mobile device. See [mobile steps](https://material.io/archive/guidelines/components/steppers.html#steppers-types-of-steps) for its inspiration.\n\n### Text\n\nThis is essentially a back/next button positioned correctly. You must implement the textual description yourself, however, an example is provided below for reference.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/steppers/TextMobileStepper.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n### Text with Carousel effect\n\nThis demo is very similar to the previous, the difference is the usage of [react-swipeable-views](https://github.com/oliviertassinari/react-swipeable-views) to make the transition of steps.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/steppers/SwipeableTextMobileStepper.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n### Dots\n\nUse dots when the number of steps isn’t large.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/steppers/DotsMobileStepper.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n### Прогресс\n\nUse a progress bar when there are many steps, or if there are steps that need to be inserted during the process (based on responses to earlier steps).\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/steppers/ProgressMobileStepper.js\", \"bg\": true}}"
