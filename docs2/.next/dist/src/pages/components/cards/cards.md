Elements, like text and images, should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.\n\n## Simple Card\n\nAlthough cards can support multiple actions, UI controls, and an overflow menu, use restraint and remember that cards are entry points to more complex and detailed information.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/cards/SimpleCard.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n### Outlined Card\n\nSet `variant=\"outlined\"` to render an outlined card.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/cards/OutlinedCard.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Complex Interaction\n\nOn desktop, card content can expand.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/cards/RecipeReviewCard.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Media\n\nExample of a card using an image to reinforce the content.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/cards/MediaCard.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\nBy default, we use the combination of a `<div>` element and a *background image* to display the media. It can be problematic in some situations. For instance, you might want to display a video or a responsive image. Use the `component` property for these use cases:\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/cards/ImgMediaCard.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n> ‚ö†Ô∏è When `component=\"img\"`, CardMedia relies on `object-fit` for centering the image. It's not supported by IE 11.\n\n## UI Controls\n\nSupplemental actions within the card are explicitly called out using icons, text, and UI controls, typically placed at the bottom of the card.\n\nHere's an example of a media control card.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/cards/MediaControlCard.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Customization\n\nüëë If you are looking for inspiration, you can check [MUI Treasury's customization examples](https://mui-treasury.com/components/card).\n\n"
