Users can also rate products they’ve purchased.</p>\n\n## Simple ratings\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/rating/SimpleRating.js\"}}\n\n## Customized ratings\n\nHere are some examples of customizing the component. You can learn more about this in the\n[overrides documentation page](/customization/components/).\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/rating/CustomizedRatings.js\"}}\n\n## Hover feedback\n\nYou can display a label on hover to help users pick the correct rating value.\nThe demo uses the `onChangeActive` prop.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/rating/HoverRating.js\"}}\n\n## Half ratings\n\nThe rating can display any float number with the `value` prop.\nUse the `precision` prop to define the minimum increment value change allowed.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/rating/HalfRating.js\"}}\n\n## Sizes\n\nFancy larger or smaller ratings? Use the `size` prop.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/rating/RatingSize.js\"}}\n\n## Accessibility\n\n(WAI tutorial: https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/custom-controls/#a-star-rating)\n\nThe accessibility of this component relies on:\n\n- A radio group is used with its fields visually hidden.\nIt contains six radio buttons, one for each star and another for 0 stars, which is checked by default. Make sure you are providing a `name` prop that is unique to the parent form.\n- The labels for the radio buttons contain actual text (“1 Star”, “2 Stars”, …), make sure you provide a `getLabelText` prop when the page language is not English.\n"
