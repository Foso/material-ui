It's an alternative to react-popper.</p>\n\nSome important features of the `Popper` component:\n\n- ðŸ•· Popper relies on the 3rd party library ([Popper.js](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js)) for perfect positioning.\n- ðŸ’„ It's an alternative API to react-popper. It aims for simplicity.\n- ðŸ“¦ [10 kB gzipped](/size-snapshot) ([7 kB](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=popper.js) from Popper.js).\n- The children is [`Portal`](/components/portal/) to the body of the document to avoid rendering problems.\nYou can disable this behavior with `disablePortal`.\n- The scroll isn't blocked like with the [`Popover`](/components/popover/) component.\nThe placement of the popper updates with the available area in the viewport.\n- Clicking away does not hide the `Popper` component.\n  If you need this behavior, you can use [`ClickAwayListener`](/components/click-away-listener/) - see the example in the [menu documentation section](/components/menus/#menulist-composition).\n- The `anchorEl` is passed as the reference object to create a new `Popper.js` instance.\n\n## Simple Popper\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/popper/SimplePopper.js\"}}\n\n## Transitions\n\nThe open/close state of the popper can be animated with a render prop child and a transition component.\nThis component should respect the following conditions:\n\n- Be a direct child descendent of the popper.\n- Call the `onEnter` callback prop when the enter transition starts.\n- Call the `onExited` callback prop when the exit transition is completed.\nThese two callbacks allow the popper to unmount the child content when closed and fully transitioned.\n\nPopper has built-in support for [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group).\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/popper/TransitionsPopper.js\"}}\n\nAlternatively, you can use [react-spring](https://github.com/react-spring/react-spring).\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/popper/SpringPopper.js\"}}\n\n## Positioned Popper\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/popper/PositionedPopper.js\", \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Scroll playground\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/popper/ScrollPlayground.js\", \"hideHeader\": true, \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Faked reference object\n\nThe `anchorEl` property can be a reference to a fake DOM element.\nYou just need to create an object shaped like the [`ReferenceObject`](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/blob/0642ce0ddeffe3c7c033a412d4d60ce7ec8193c3/packages/popper/index.d.ts#L118-L123).\n\nHighlight part of the text to see the popper:\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/popper/FakedReferencePopper.js\"}}\n\n## Complementary projects\n\nFor more advanced use cases you might be able to take advantage of:\n\n### PopupState helper\n\nThere is a 3rd party package [`material-ui-popup-state`](https://github.com/jcoreio/material-ui-popup-state) that takes care of popper\nstate for you in most cases.\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/components/popper/PopperPopupState.js\"}}\n"
