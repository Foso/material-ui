module.exports = "# Server Rendering\n\n<p class=\"description\">The most common use case for server-side rendering is to handle the initial render when a user (or search engine crawler) first requests your app.</p>\n\nWhen the server receives the request, it renders the required component(s) into an HTML string, and then sends it as a response to the client.\nFrom that point on, the client takes over rendering duties.\n\n## Material-UI on the server\n\nMaterial-UI was designed from the ground-up with the constraint of rendering on the server, but it's up to you to make sure it's correctly integrated.\nIt's important to provide the page with the required CSS, otherwise the page will render with just the HTML then wait for the CSS to be injected by the client, causing it to flicker (FOUC).\nTo inject the style down to the client, we need to:\n\n1. Create a fresh, new [`ServerStyleSheets`](/styles/api/#serverstylesheets) instance on every request.\n2. Render the React tree with the server-side collector.\n3. Pull the CSS out.\n4. Pass the CSS along to the client.\n\nOn the client side, the CSS will be injected a second time before removing the server-side injected CSS.\n\n## Setting Up\n\nIn the following recipe, we are going to look at how to set up server-side rendering.\n\n### The theme\n\nCreate a theme that will be shared between the client and the server:\n\n`theme.js`\n\n```js\nimport { createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\nimport red from '@material-ui/core/colors/red';\n\n// Create a theme instance.\nconst theme = createMuiTheme({\n  palette: {\n    primary: {\n      main: '#556cd6',\n    },\n    secondary: {\n      main: '#19857b',\n    },\n    error: {\n      main: red.A400,\n    },\n    background: {\n      default: '#fff',\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nexport default theme;\n```\n\n### The server-side\n\nThe following is the outline for what the server-side is going to look like.\nWe are going to set up an [Express middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) using [app.use](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html) to handle all requests that come in to the server.\nIf you're unfamiliar with Express or middleware, just know that the handleRender function will be called every time the server receives a request.\n\n`server.js`\n\n```js\nimport express from 'express';\n\n// We are going to fill these out in the sections to follow.\nfunction renderFullPage(html, css) {\n  /* ... */\n}\n\nfunction handleRender(req, res) {\n  /* ... */\n}\n\nconst app = express();\n\n// This is fired every time the server-side receives a request.\napp.use(handleRender);\n\nconst port = 3000;\napp.listen(port);\n```\n\n### Handling the Request\n\nThe first thing that we need to do on every request is create a new `ServerStyleSheets`.\n\nWhen rendering, we will wrap `App`, the root component,\ninside a [`StylesProvider`](/styles/api/#stylesprovider) and [`ThemeProvider`](/styles/api/#themeprovider) to make the style configuration and the `theme` available to all components in the component tree.\n\nThe key step in server-side rendering is to render the initial HTML of the component **before** we send it to the client side. To do this, we use [ReactDOMServer.renderToString()](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html).\n\nWe then get the CSS from the `sheets` using `sheets.toString()`.\nWe will see how this is passed along in the `renderFullPage` function.\n\n```jsx\nimport express from 'express';\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server';\nimport { ServerStyleSheets, ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\nimport App from './App';\nimport theme from './theme';\n\nfunction handleRender(req, res) {\n  const sheets = new ServerStyleSheets();\n\n  // Render the component to a string.\n  const html = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(\n    sheets.collect(\n      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>\n        <App />\n      </ThemeProvider>,\n    ),\n  );\n\n  // Grab the CSS from the sheets.\n  const css = sheets.toString();\n\n  // Send the rendered page back to the client.\n  res.send(renderFullPage(html, css));\n}\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use('/build', express.static('build'));\n\n// This is fired every time the server-side receives a request.\napp.use(handleRender);\n\nconst port = 3000;\napp.listen(port);\n```\n\n### Inject Initial Component HTML and CSS\n\nThe final step on the server-side is to inject the initial component HTML and CSS into a template to be rendered on the client side.\n\n```js\nfunction renderFullPage(html, css) {\n  return `\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html>\n      <head>\n        <title>My page</title>\n        <style id=\"jss-server-side\">${css}</style>\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">${html}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  `;\n}\n```\n\n### The Client Side\n\nThe client side is straightforward. All we need to do is remove the server-side generated CSS.\nLet's take a look at the client file:\n\n`client.js`\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport { ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\nimport App from './App';\nimport theme from './theme';\n\nfunction Main() {\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    const jssStyles = document.querySelector('#jss-server-side');\n    if (jssStyles) {\n      jssStyles.parentElement.removeChild(jssStyles);\n    }\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>\n      <App />\n    </ThemeProvider>\n  );\n}\n\nReactDOM.hydrate(<Main />, document.querySelector('#root'));\n```\n\n## Reference implementations\n\nWe host different reference implementations which you can find in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui) under the [`/examples`](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/tree/master/examples) folder:\n\n- [The reference implementation of this tutorial](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/tree/master/examples/ssr)\n- [Gatsby](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/tree/master/examples/gatsby)\n- [Next.js](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/tree/master/examples/nextjs)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCheck out the FAQ answer: [My App doesn't render correctly on the server](/getting-started/faq/#my-app-doesnt-render-correctly-on-the-server).\n"
