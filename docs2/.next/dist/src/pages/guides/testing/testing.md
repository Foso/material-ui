module.exports = "# Testing\n\n<p class=\"description\">Write tests to prevent regressions and write better code.</p>\n\nExamples in this guide use [global methods from Mocha](https://mochajs.org/api/global.html), not [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api).\n\n## Internal\n\nMaterial-UI has **a wide range** of tests so we can\niterate with confidence on the components, for instance, the visual regression tests provided by [Argos-CI](https://www.argos-ci.com/Foso/material-ui) have proven to be really helpful.\nTo learn more about the internal tests, you can have a look at the [README](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/blob/master/test/README.md).\n\n## Userspace\n\nWhat about writing tests in userspace? The Material-UI styling infrastructure uses some helper functions built on top of [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) to make the process easier, which we are exposing. You can take advantage of them if you so choose.\nWe use almost exclusively full DOM rendering APIs. We encourage you to do the same especially\nif your components rely on custom themes. Tests using shallow rendering APIs become more brittle\nwith the amount of provider components they require.\n\n### Full DOM rendering\n\nFull DOM rendering is ideal for use cases where you have components that may interact with DOM APIs or may require the full lifecycle in order to fully test the component (e.g., `componentDidMount` etc.).\n\nThe `createMount()` function is provided for this situation.\nAside from wrapping the enzyme API, it provides a `cleanUp` function.\n\n### Shallow rendering\n\nShallow rendering is useful to constrain your testing to a component as a unit. This also ensures that your tests aren't indirectly asserting behavior of child components.\nShallow rendering was created to test components in isolation. This means without leaking child implementation details such as the context.\n\nThe `createShallow()` function can be used for this situation. Aside from wrapping the enzyme API, it provides a `dive` and `untilSelector` option.\n\n### Render to string\n\nRendering to a string is useful to test the behavior of the components that are used on the server.\nYou can take advantage of this to assert the generated HTML string.\n\nThe `createRender()` function is ideal for this. This is just an alias for the enzyme API, which is only exposed for consistency.\n\n## API\n\n### `createMount([options]) => mount`\n\nGenerate an enhanced mount function with the needed context.\nPlease refer to the [enzyme API documentation](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html) for further details on the `mount` function.\n\n#### Arguments\n\n1. `options` (*Object* [optional])\n  - `options.mount` (*Function* [optional]): The mount function to enhance, it uses **enzyme by default**.\n  - The other keys are forwarded to the options argument of `enzyme.mount()`.\n\n#### Returns\n\n`mount` (*mount*): A mount function.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```jsx\nimport { createMount } from '@material-ui/core/test-utils';\nimport { ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\n\ndescribe('<MyComponent />', () => {\n  let mount;\n\n  function MySuccessButton({ children }) {\n    return (\n      <ThemeProvider theme={{ success: { main: '#fff' } }}>\n        {children}\n      </ThemeProvider>\n    );\n  }\n\n  before(() => {\n    mount = createMount();\n  });\n\n  after(() => {\n    mount.cleanUp();\n  });\n\n  it('should work', () => {\n    const wrapper = mount(<MockedTheme><MySuccessButton /></MockedTheme>);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n\n### `createShallow([options]) => shallow`\n\nGenerate an enhanced shallow function with the needed context.\nPlease refer to the [enzyme API documentation](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) for further details on the `shallow` function.\n\n\n#### Arguments\n\n1. `options` (*Object* [optional])\n  - `options.shallow` (*Function* [optional]): The shallow function to enhance, it uses **enzyme by default**.\n  - `options.untilSelector` (*String* [optional]): Recursively shallow renders the children until it can find the provided selector. It's useful to drill down higher-order components.\n  - `options.dive` (*Boolean* [optional]): Shallow function renders the one non-DOM child of the current wrapper, and returns a wrapper around the result.\n  - The other keys are forwarded to the options argument of `enzyme.shallow()`.\n\n#### Returns\n\n`shallow` (*shallow*): A shallow function.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```jsx\nimport { createShallow } from '@material-ui/core/test-utils';\n\ndescribe('<MyComponent />', () => {\n  let shallow;\n\n  before(() => {  // This is Mocha; in Jest, use beforeAll\n    shallow = createShallow();\n  });\n\n  it('should work', () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(<MyComponent />);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n### `createRender([options]) => render`\n\nGenerate a render to string function with the needed context.\nPlease refer to the [enzyme API documentation](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/render.html) for further details on the `render` function.\n\n#### Arguments\n\n1. `options` (*Object* [optional])\n  - `options.render` (*Function* [optional]): The render function to enhance, it uses **enzyme by default**.\n  - The other keys are forwarded to the options argument of `enzyme.render()`.\n\n#### Returns\n\n`render` (*Function*): A render to string function.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```jsx\nimport { createRender } from '@material-ui/core/test-utils';\n\ndescribe('<MyComponent />', () => {\n  let render;\n\n  before(() => {\n    render = createRender();\n  });\n\n  it('should work', () => {\n    const wrapper = render(<MyComponent />);\n  });\n});\n```\n"
