module.exports = "# Usage\n\n<p class=\"description\">Get started with React and Material-UI in no time.</p>\n\nMaterial-UI components work in isolation.\n**They are self-supporting**, and will only inject the styles they need to display.\nThey don't rely on any global style-sheets such as [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/).\n\nYou can use any of the components as demonstrated in the documentation.\nPlease refer to each component's [demo page](/components/buttons/) to see how they should be imported.\n\n## Quick start\n\nHere's a quick example to get you started, **it's literally all you need**:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport Button from '@material-ui/core/Button';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Button variant=\"contained\" color=\"primary\">\n      Hello World\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#app'));\n```\n\nYes, this really is all you need to get started, as you can see in this live and interactive demo:\n\n{{\"demo\": \"pages/getting-started/usage/Usage.js\", \"hideHeader\": true, \"bg\": true}}\n\n## Globals\n\nMaterial-UI usage experience can be improved with a handful of important globals that youâ€™ll need to be aware of.\n\n### Responsive meta tag\n\nMaterial-UI is developed mobile-first, a strategy in which we first write code for mobile devices, and then scale up components as necessary using CSS media queries.\nTo ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices, add the responsive viewport meta tag to your `<head>` element.\n\n```html\n<meta\n  name=\"viewport\"\n  content=\"minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1, width=device-width\"\n/>\n```\n\n### CssBaseline\n\nMaterial-UI provides an optional [CssBaseline](/components/css-baseline/) component.\nIt fixes some inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing slightly more opinionated resets to common HTML elements.\n\n## Versioned Documentation\n\nThis documentation always reflects the latest stable version of Material-UI.\nYou can find older versions of the documentation on a [separate page](https://material-ui.com/versions/).\n\n## Next steps\n\nNow that you have an idea of the basic setup, it's time to learn more about:\n\n- How to provide [the Material Design font and typography](/components/typography/).\n- How to take advantage of the [theming solution](/customization/theming/).\n- How to [override](/customization/components/) the look and feel of the components.\n"
