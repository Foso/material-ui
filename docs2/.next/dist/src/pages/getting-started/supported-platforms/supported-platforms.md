module.exports = "# Supported Platforms\n\n<p class=\"description\">Learn about the platforms, from modern to old, that are supported by Material-UI.</p>\n\n## Browser\n\nMaterial-UI supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms.\nIt also supports Internet Explorer 11.\nYou don't need to provide any JavaScript polyfill as it manages unsupported browser features internally and in isolation.\n\n| IE    | Edge   | Firefox | Chrome | Safari | Googlebot |\n|:------|:-------|:--------|:-------|:-------|:----------|\n| 11    | >= 14  | >= 52   | >= 49  | >= 10  | âœ…        |\n\nBecause Googlebot uses a web rendering service (WRS) to index the page content, it's critical that Material-UI supports it.\n[WRS regularly updates the rendering engine it uses](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/05/the-new-evergreen-googlebot.html).\nYou can expect Material-UI's components to render without major issues.\n\n## Server\n\nBecause Material-UI supports server-side rendering, it needs to support the latest, stable releases of [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node).\nWhere possible, the [LTS versions that are in maintenance](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#lts-schedule1) are supported. We recommend using **node v10.x** or newer. However we still support **node v8.x**. The support of **node v8.x** will be stopped in Material-UI Version 5.\n\n### CSS prefixing\n\nBe aware that some CSS features [require](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss/issues/279) an additional postprocessing step\nthat adds vendor-specific prefixes.\nThese prefixes are automatically added to the client thanks to [`jss-plugin-vendor-prefixer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jss-plugin-vendor-prefixer).\n\nThe CSS served on this documentation is processed with [`autoprefixer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer).\nYou can use [the documentation implementation](https://github.com/Foso/material-ui/blob/47aa5aeaec1d4ac2c08fd0e84277d6b91e497557/pages/_document.js#L123) as inspiration.\nBe aware that it has an implication with the performance of the page.\nIt's a must-do for static pages, but it needs to be put in balance with not doing anything when rendering dynamic pages.\n\n## React\n\nMaterial-UI supports the most recent versions of React, starting with ^16.8.0 (the one with the hooks).\nHave a look at the older [versions](https://material-ui.com/versions/) for backward compatibility.\n"
